  Project SafeHome is a user-friendly website to help a user determine the earthquake risk level of an SF address. Ultimately, we hope to raise awareness for residents and encourage property owners and developers to improve the earthquake rating of their buildings in the city, reducing SF’s overall vulnerability to disaster. Try it out at [safehome.report](https://safehome.report/)!

	<p>
		SF Civic Tech is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves
		technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. Each week,
		we actively work together to improve the City and County of San Francisco,
		often using technology to support our efforts. By connecting people,
		organizations, resources, tools, and networks to build for San Francisco, we
		will all thrive.
	</p>

	<p>
		SF Civic Tech is a safe space for experimentation, learning and practicing
		skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to affect and encourage
		positive change. Whenever possible, we proactively reach out to those who are
		left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. Those people, in our
		opinion, represent our most desirable source for experiences, knowledge, and
		thoughts. We fail without their involvement.
	</p>

	<p>
		SF Civic Tech was originally founded in 2013 as Code for San Francisco, part
		of the Code for America Brigade Network. After the
		<a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/reflections-on-the-brigade-networks-next-chapter/">sunsetting
		of the Code for America Brigade Program</a> in 2023, the organization renamed
		itself to SF Civic Tech in 2024 and became an independent 501(c)3 tax-exempt
		non-profit.  SF Civic Tech is also a member of the
		<a href="https://www.civictechnologists.org/">Alliance of Civic Technologists</a>.

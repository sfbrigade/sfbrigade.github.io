  The goal of the Bay Area SMB Resource Portal is to build a suite of tools and resources using web technologies for small and medium businesses across the Bay Areas.

  Our dedicated team of volunteers built a working site called the [Bay Area Relief Portal](https://sfbayrelief.org), which currently helps small businesses and non-profits easily search for and apply to funding sources (eg. grants & loans).

  Currently we are looking to expand beyond the portal to include other forms of support such as pro bono legal services, educational workshops, funds for individuals/contractors, and hiring resources etc. We are also open to suggestions from the community on how we can improve the platform.

  By building the Bay Area SMB Resource Portal we hope to help alleviate some of the negative economic impact faced by small business owners and help communities re-build and thrive.

  Everyday, paramedics make life and death decisions when choosing where to take patients. And they have to rely on their own experience to make the right choices.

  The current $2m/year application used by the city is inadequate, so TeamBATS is piloting an app that helps paramedics know which ERs have available beds, and ERs can learn about patients who are en route.

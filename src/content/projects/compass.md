  10% of students in SFUSD have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) that details specific academic and behavioral goals. Data collection is both the backbone and achilles heel of this system. Good data provides guidance and proof of progress but is also onerous to collect. Let’s help our teachers and students by making data collection simpler, more flexible and maybe even a little fun.

  Water The Trees is a platform that crowd sources tree planting and maintenance. We believe in the power of trees to restore natural habitat for animals, insects, and fauna. We are interested in continuous massive tree planting events to help sequester carbon and stabilize climate change extremes.

  Water the Trees is an open source project run by tree planting volunteers at Sierra Club, Public Works, and developers at Code for San Francisco.

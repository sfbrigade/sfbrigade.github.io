  Check us out at [supportsfschools.org](http://supportsfschools.org)! Our target users are people who live or work in San Francisco and want to support local schools but don’t know how. This is a fun and important project to bring transparency, engagement, and dollars to the school district.

  Sep 2024 update: Our MVP is live at [supportsfschools.org](http://supportsfschools.org)! We focus on helping people connect with schools near where they live or work, and to find where to donate their money or volunteer their time. The MVP is high school only, so we’ll soon be expanding to elementary and middle schools.
